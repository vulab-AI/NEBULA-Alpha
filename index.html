        <p>
          The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. 
          This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. 
          To address these limitations, we introduce <b>NEBULA</b>, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained <i>capability tests</i> for precise skill diagnosis with systematic <i>stress tests</i> that measure robustness.
          A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison.
          Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

          The primary impact of this evaluation design is its ability to provide a deep, diagnostic analysis of an agent's abilities, moving beyond ambiguous, task-level success rates. By using a principle of controlled-variable isolation, each task family is designed to test a single capability while minimizing the influence of others, ensuring that performance can be unambiguously attributed to the specific skill being evaluated. This methodology is used to pinpoint the precise reasons for an agent's failure, transforming a simple success metric into an interpretable, multi-faceted signal that reveals specific weaknesses, such as difficulties with spatial reasoning or dynamic adaptation, which are often obscured in traditional benchmarks.

          This figure provides examples from the <b>NEBULA Stress Test</b> suite, illustrating the Stability and Adaptability tasks across three progressive difficulty levels. The Stability Score tasks evaluate the smoothness of an agent's actions by increasing the precision required, moving from a simple stack at Level 1 to a more complex, multi-object arrangement at Level 3. The Adaptability tasks assess an agent's capacity to adjust to dynamic changes during execution, beginning with a sudden object movement (Level 1), advancing to a mid-task instruction change (Level 2), and culminating in a command abort that requires rapid re-planning (Level 3).
        </p>
        <p>
          The impact of these Stress Tests is to enable a more profound and diagnostic evaluation than what is possible with traditional success rates, by quantifying system performance under targeted operational pressures. This approach can be used to identify critical performance bottlenecks, reveal an agent's failure points under pressure, and assess its readiness for real-world deployment where conditions are often unpredictable. To specifically diagnose issues in dynamic scenarios, metrics like inference speed and latency are evaluated in conjunction with the Adaptability test to understand how an agent's system responsiveness directly impacts its ability to handle real-time environmental changes and goal shifts.

          This figure presents two radar charts summarizing model performance across six capability task families. The left chart shows the mean and standard deviation of success rates across all models for each task family, broken down by three difficulty levels. The right chart displays the average performance of individual models on Easy and Medium tasks, which allows for a direct comparison across different architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The charts reveal that while most models demonstrate strong performance in Perception and Language tasks, their capabilities in other areas are much more varied. Spatial reasoning remains a key bottleneck for the majority of models. Furthermore, all models struggle significantly with Dynamic Adaptation and Robustness tasks, with performance approaching zero at higher difficulty levels. These results expose a critical gap in current VLA capabilities and highlight an urgent need for research into real-time adaptive planning and out-of-distribution generalization.

          This figure shows the stress test evaluations for four different models, comparing their performance across three increasing stress levels. The evaluation consists of four distinct tests: inference frequency, measured in Hertz; latency, measured in milliseconds; a stability score, on a scale from 0 to 1; and adaptability, measured by success rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          These results reveal a consistent degradation in performance for all evaluated models as stress levels increase, highlighting their sensitivity to deployment challenges. GR00T is the most resilient model, maintaining a high inference frequency and demonstrating a modest ability to adapt to changing conditions. In contrast, most other models fail almost completely in the adaptability test and show significant weaknesses in either speed or stability, indicating that they are not yet equipped to handle the demands of dynamic, real-world environments.
